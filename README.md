### Directions for using Webstorm
1. First step I did was install Webstorm from JetBrains
2. Then I requested my license from Webstrom and got approved right away
3. I then installed Git as a local Program
4. I already had a GitHub account so I didnt have to download it so I just connected my webstorm to my Github
5. Then my terminal popped up and I typed in " pkgutil --file-info /usr/bin/git"
6. Then I opened up preferences in webstrom
7. Went to version control then git 
8. In the search box at the top I pasted in what was given in my terminal after it printed "path:"
